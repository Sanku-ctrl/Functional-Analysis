## Abstract / Summary

This project demonstrates the relevance of Functional Analysis in a variety of applied contexts, particularly focusing on the concepts of convex sets, convex functions, and Lagrange duality. We explore how these mathematical tools are indispensable in modern optimization, with broad applications in economic modeling, financial decision-making, and data-driven machine learning algorithms. The work includes a theoretical case study solving an infinite-dimensional quadratic minimization problem on a Hilbert space, showcasing the power of these methods beyond finite-dimensional settings.
